# Internship Data Science Projects
This repository contains projects I worked on for my internship at codsoft.

## Project 1: Iris Flower Classification

### Description
- **Objective**: Implemented a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on features.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.

### Key Features
- Utilized the famous Iris dataset to predict the species of flowers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations using Seaborn.

## Project 2: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Description
- **Objective**: Developed a predictive model to determine survival likelihood on the Titanic dataset.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.

### Key Features
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Evaluation of model performance and feature importance analysis.

## Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Description
- **Objective**: Created a fraud detection system using machine learning on credit card transaction data.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.

### Key Features
- Data preprocessing and imbalance handling for fraud detection.
- Focus on model interpretability and false-positive minimization.

## Project 4: Car Sales Prediction

### Description
- **Objective**: Built a predictive model to forecast car sales using historical data.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.

### Key Features
